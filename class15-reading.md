- In 2014, 70% of tech employees in Silicon Valley were male.
- In the 1980s a lot of computers were being used for games. Games were mostly marketed towards men.
- A 1985 study showed that 73% of men used a computer on a weekly basis, compared to 45% of women.
- No coincidence that the console that was known to save the industry was called a gameboy.
- 45% of women are more likely than men to leave careers in tech because woemn often feel isolated due to a lack of female role models and being excluded from buddy networks among men.
- Diversity efforts are most successful when driven by a commitment from company leaders.
- Diverse teams are smarter and more creative.
- Diverse companies perform better.
- Not being able to attract employees from underrespresented backgrounds leads to missing out on talent.
- Diverse employees are better able to serve diverse user base.
