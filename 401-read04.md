# Database Modeling 

## Review, Research, and Discussion 
1. Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
- Maintanence is easier
- Testing is better
- Improved functionality 
2. In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
- They would be used if there is any repetition acrross several tests.
3. What is one downside of Test Driven Development
- You may miss an expected result and tests may pass resulting in problems down the road.
4. Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
- Constructor/prototype classes are objects and Classes creates an instance.
5. Why REST?

    - I would like to learn more about coding mongodb.
    - I would like to know more anbout the pros and cons of using both.
3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
