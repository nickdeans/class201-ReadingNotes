# Basics of HTML, CSS, and JS

**Structural markup** - The elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs
**Semantic markup** - Which providesextra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation(and who said it), the meaning of acronyms, and so on.

## Headings

HTML has six "levels" of headings.

```
<h1>
<h2>
<h3>
<h4>
<h5>
<h6>
```

h1 is used for the main headings. h2 is used for the subheadings and so on.

### Paragraphs

To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening tag and closing tag.

```
<p1></p2>
```

### Bold and Italic

By embedding words in "b" tags we can make characters appear bold. When enclosing words with "i" tags we can make characters appear italic.

```
<b></b>
<i></i>
```

### Superscript and Subscript

The "sup" element is used to conatain characters that should be superscript such as the suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts like raising a number to a powe4r such as 2.

The "sub" element is used to conatain characters that should be subscript. It is commonly used with foot notes or chemical formulas such as H2O.

```
<sup>
<sub>
```
