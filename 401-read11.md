# Event Driven Applications

## Review, Research, Discussion
- Why is access control important?
It gives applications the ability to allow users different accessibility. For companies it is incredibly useful given the amount of roles they may have.
- Describe an application that would need access control.
Logging into your companies application that gives you different access. You may recieve admin access, ability to edit, ability to see certain things, ability to do or see pay roll, etc.
- What is a role used for?
A role is used to give an employee an identity that correlates with the type of access they may have.
- Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?
Because as more users are given roles it is easier to just assign them the role and grant them the accessibility involved rather than individually giving users certain access every time they sign up.

## Vocabulary 
- Authorization - Validates that a user can have certain access and abilities within an application.
- Role Based Access Control - Vaidates users accessibility depending on their role.
- Capabilities - What a user is capable of seeing or doing within the application.

- I have better understanding of event driven programming and specifically using EventEmitter.
- Like jQuery, the EventEmiiter node module uses the "on" for event handlers.
- Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
- I would like to know more about how common EventEmitter is used in the industry.
- I would like to know the pros and cons with using jQuery vs EventEmitter.
- I would like to see more examples of object oriented programming.
- What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
- I am curious about the implemnentation of event driven programming and object oriented programming.
