# Custom Hooks

## Review, Research, Discussion
- What does a component’s lifecycle refer to? -  A series of methods that are invoked in several different stages of the components existence. 
- Why do you sometimes need to “wrap” functions in useCallback when called from within useEffect - It helps solve the problem of a helper function being redeclared with every re-render and now you will get the same function reference. It only changes when parameters change.
- Why are functional components preferred over class components? - Functional components for many may be easier to read because they are plain javascript and don't need to write state or lifecycle methods. You ultimately end up with less code and offer better performance booost.
