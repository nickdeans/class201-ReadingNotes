**Nested Lists** - You can put a second list inside of a listed item element to create a sub-list or nested list.

## Boxes

### Box Dimensions (width,height)

By default a box is set sized just big enough to hold its content. To set your own dimensions for a box you can use the height and width properties.

The most popular ways to specify the size of a box are to use pixels, percenatages, or ems.

### Border, Margin, & Padding

Every Box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance.

1. **Border**

   - Every Box has a border. The border seperates the edge of one box from another.

2. **Margin**
   - Margins are outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes.
3. **Padding**
   - Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it.
