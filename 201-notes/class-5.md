# HTML Images; CSS Color & Text

## Images

A picture can say a thousand words, and great images help make the difference between an average-looking site and a really engaging one.

### Adding Images

To add images you will use the "img" tag, an "src" attribute which tells the browser where it can find the image file, an "alt" which provides a text description, and a title which will provide additional information on the image.

```
<img src="images/nike.jpeg" alt="Nike Picture" title="The nike symbol is cool" />
```

**Height** - This specifies the height of the image in pixels.
**Width** - This specifies the width of the images in pixels.

### Where to place images in your code?

1. Before a paragraph
2. Inside the start of a paragraph
3. In the middle of a paragraph

### Image Formats

- JPEG
- GIF
- PNG

## Color

The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways.

1. RGB Values
   - These express colors in terms of how much red, green, and blue are used to make it up. Ex. rgb(100,120,90)
2. Hex Codes
   - These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green, and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or a hash # sign. Ex. #ee3e80
3. Color Names
   - There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. Ex. DarkCyan

### Contrast

When picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be eligible.

## Text

**Specifying Typefaces** - The _font-family_ property allows you to specify the typeface that should be used for any text inside the elements(s) to which a css rule applies.

**Size of Type** - The _Font-size_ property enables you to specify a size for the font. You can youse Pixels or Percentages to control the size.
