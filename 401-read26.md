# Context API

## Review, Research, Discussion
- Describe use cases for useMemo() and useReducer() - useMemo is a React hook that memorizes the output of a function. It accepts two arguments(a function and list of dependencies) and will call the function and return the value. useReducer is a React hook that is used in place of useState when you ma  have complex state logic that involves several state-values or when state depends on previous one.
- Why do custom hooks need the use prefix? - It lets you know that these functions are intended to be used with React and to obey implicit rules such as scope limited to React code.
- What do custom hooks usually do? - Custom hooks allow you to create functionality that can be used across different components with the ability to hook into component lifecycles and state.
- Using any list of custom hooks, research and name one that you think will be useful in your applications - useOnlineStatus is a pretty interesting hook you can introduce into your application. It allows users to see who is online within an application by checkoing the users network status to determine if they are connected to the internet or not. 
- Describe how a hook that fetches API data might work. - By using useEffect you can fecth data with axios from an API and set the data in the local state of the component with state's update function.
