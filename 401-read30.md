# Redux - Asynchronous Actions

## Review, Research, and Discussion 
1. How granular should your reducers be? Depending on how many actions you have, you should have as many reducers. Reducers should be created and combined and also do one thing.
2. Pro or Con – multiple reducers can “fire” when a commonly named action is dispatched. - This is a pro if you are able to manage your reducers and actions efficiently.
3. Name a strategy for preventing the above - Using Async middleware enable dispatching multiple actions in a row.

## Vocabulary 
- Store - Holds the whole state tree of your applciation. Only way to change state is with an action.
- Combined Reducers - A helper function that turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to createStore.
