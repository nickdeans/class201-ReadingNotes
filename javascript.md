# Dynamic web pages and JavaScipt

## What is Javascript?

- JavaScript is where we can change how the page behaves.

**JavaScript** is written in plain text, just like _HTML_ and _CSS_

## Tips for JavaScript

- It is the best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript file.
- If you view the source code of the page in the browser, the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML, because the script works with the model of the web page that the browser has created.
