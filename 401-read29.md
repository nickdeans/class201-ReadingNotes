# Redux - Combined Reducers

## Review, Research, and Discussion
1. Why choose Redux instead of the Context API for global state? - Redux makes it easier to manage state when dealing with scaling your app.
2. What is the purpose of a reducer? - The reducer function determines what changes neeed to happen to the applications state after receiving an action. 
3. What does an action contain? - It contains a payload from the application to store.
4. Why do we need to copy the state in a reducer? If state is changed, the reducer must create a new object, and making a copy is a way to describe the unchanged part.
