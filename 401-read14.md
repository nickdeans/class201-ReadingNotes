# Event Driven Architecture

## Review, Research, and Discussion
- Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
    - FIFO queues offer many of the same features but have two advantages of upporting ordering and exactly once processing.
- How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
    - A server can receive a response from the client verifying received message.
- What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?
    - The observer pattern which is a software design pattern in which an object maintains a list of dependencies and notifies them automatically of any state changes.
- How do you test an event driven system?
    - There are multiple ways to test event driven systems: Unit tests, End-to-End tests, and service tests.

## Vocabulary 
- FIFO Queue - First in First Out queue in which requests are processed in the order they arrive. It is the most common type of queue.
- Pub/Sub - Messaging pattern where senders of messages(publishers) do not program the messages to be sent directly to specific receivers(subscribers).
