# Props and State 

## Review, Research, and Discussion
- Does a deployed React application require a server? - You don't need a server for a deployed react app but Node allows you to work with react more easily.
- Why do we prefer to test a React application at the behavior rather than the unit level? - Because behavior tests test how the app is behaving as opposed to testing the implementation of the behavior. 
- What does npm run build do? - runs the script "build" and creates a script that runs your application and in our case server.js.
- Describe the actual composition / architecture of a React application - A front-end technology and JavaScript framework that only works with the View layer. React gives you a template language and few function hooks to render HTML.
