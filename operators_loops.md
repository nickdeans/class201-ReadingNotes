# Operators

1. Logical Operators
   - Comparison operators usually return single values of _true_ or _false_.
   - Logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator. :) :) :)

**&&** Logical And - This operator tests more than one condition.

**||** Logical Or - This operator tests at least one condition.

**!** Logical Not - This operator takes a single Boolean value and inverts it.

# Loops

**Loops** - Check a condition. If it returns True, a code block will run. Then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns true, the code block will run again. It repeats until the condition returns false.

## Three types of loops

1. For
   - If you need to run code a specific number of times use a FOR loop. Most common loop usuually told how many times to run.
1. While
   - If you do not know how many time to run use this loop. It will continue to loop as long as the condition is true.
1. Do While
   - Similar to While loop but will always run the statements inside the curly braces at least once, even if the condition evaluates to false.
