# Express REST API

1. Name 3 real world use cases where you’d want to change the request with custom middleware
2. True or false: The route handler is middleware?
3. In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the browser?
4. At what point in the request lifecycle can you “inject” middleware?
5. What can cause express to error with “Request headers sent twice, cannot start a second response”

## Preview 
1. Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
    - I learned about Classes previously and how they are used as a template to create objects. I am more comfortable with the syntax after reading about class function declarations and expressions.
    - Subclasses are children to the parent class and need to be called using the super() function before using "this"
    - I learned more about routing methods and how they are defined using Express app object and that correspond to the HTTP methods such as the app.get() to handle GET requests.
2. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
    - I would like to learn more about how common using classes are compared to using regular constructors in the industry?
    - I would like to see more examples of routes having two callback functions and their use cases.
    - 
3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
    - I would still like to get more experience using POST routes and learning more about the uses and frequency GET and POST routes are used.
