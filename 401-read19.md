# AWS: Events

## Review, Research, and Discussion
- Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
    - Standard queues provide best effort ordering meaning they try to output data in which the order they come in but occasionally it will output out of order. FIFO is strictly first in first out meaning it exactly one processing and always outputs in order.
- How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
    - Clients can send back a message/event notifying the server that the message was received.
- What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?
    - The observer pattern which is a software design pattern in which an object maintains a list of dependencies and notifies them automatically of any state changes.
- How do you test an event driven system?
    - There are multiple ways to test event driven systems: Unit tests, End-to-End tests, and service tests.

## Vocabulary
- Serverless API - An application that has a cloud prvider such as AWS API Gateway that dynamically manages the allocataion and provisioning of servers for the app. The API runs in a stateless compute container that is event triggered.
- Triggers - Procedures that are stored in a database and are fired when an event happens. 
- Dynamo vs Mongo - Although similar in many ways, Mongo can be deployed anywhere and Dynamo is only available on AWS. Dynamo is a fully managed AWS service as opposed to Mongo being seld installed and self managed. Dynamo uses tables, items and attributes, and Mongo uses JSON like objects. Dynamo has access to many more AWS services to develop a complete app.
- Dynamoose vs Mongoose - Dynamoose is a modeling tool used for Dynamo and acts very similarily to the way Mongoose does with Mongo. Dynamoose allows the use of a schema and CRUD operations.
