# Ethics

## Morality, ethics of a self-driving car: Who decides who lives, dies?
- This was a very interesting article about self driving cars and the ethics they present between human safety and technology. There may be extremely rare circumstances regarding the lives of different people and that ethics invoved is how should a self driving car respond. I believe it is a very tough question to answer and I don't have a solution to the problem. I do believe in the ethics of keeping people safe and designing self driving cars to take into account virtually every possible situation and to develop an action by the car to mitigate risk and enhance safety for people.

## AI at Google: our principles
- Google believes in the profound effects that AI can have on the world and they created  7 principles and guidelines that AI should follow. The principles collectively create an ethical solution to creating AI and seek to benefit humanity and mitigate any risk. I like that one of their principles focuses on building and testing for safety. AI is only detremental to society of it is not safe.
