## Vocabulary

## Preview
- Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

    - JSON web token structure consists of Header, payload, and signature.
- Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
    - Are there different types of tokens?
    - Are tokens always used for authorization with servers?
    - What are the benefits to JWT?
- What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
    - I am interested in using tokens and creating authorization for different roles.
