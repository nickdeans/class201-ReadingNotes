# Bearer Authorization 

## Review, Research, and Discuss
- Write the following steps in the correct order:
    - Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
    - Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
    - Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint
    - Make a request to the access token endpoint
    - Receive authorization code
    - Make a request to a third-party API endpoint
    - Receive access token
- What can you do with an authorization code?
It can be used to receive a token in return.
- What can you do with an access token?
Access tokens are used by applications to make requests by the client.

## Vocabulary
Client ID - unique but piblic identifier for for apps.
Client Secret - secret known only by the application and the authorization server.
Authentication Endpoint - security endpoint that ensures only authorized devices can connect to a network or service.
Access Token Endpoint - used by the application in order to get access to a token or refresh it.
API Endpoint - can include a URL of a server or service.
Authorization Code - alphanumeric password that allows user to enter information into a securtiy protected space.
Access Token - used in token based authentication to allow an application access to an api.


## Preview
- Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
    - I heard about tokens being sent for authentication but I learned more about how JWT works.
    - I learned that the browser sends Post request or authentication info to the server, the server sends a JWT to browser, browser send back JWT on authorization header, and server sends reponse to client.
    - JSON web token structure consists of Header, payload, and signature.
- Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
    - Are there different types of tokens?
    - Are tokens always used for authorization with servers?
    - What are the benefits to JWT?
- What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
    - I am interested in using tokens and creating authorization for different roles.
