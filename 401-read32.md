1. Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks” - Redux Tool kit solves three major problems people had with Redux including configuring a Redux store that is too complicated, having to add a lot of packages to make Redux useful, and Redux requiring too much boilerplate code. Ducks offer a modular pattern that uses actions, action types, and reducers. The module must export a default function called a reducer(), must export its action creators as functions, and must have action types in the form of npm-module.
2. What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit - Redux Tool kit solves three major problems people had with Redux including configuring a Redux store that is too complicated, having to add a lot of packages to make Redux useful, and Redux requiring too much boilerplate code.
