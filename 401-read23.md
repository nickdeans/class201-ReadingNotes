# Routing

## Review, Research, and Discussion
1. Do child components have direct access to props/state from the parent? - There is no way to pass props from a child component to a parent component. Functions on the other hand can be passed from parent to child.
2. When a component “wraps” another component, how does the child component’s output get rendered? - When the wrapped component is rendered the ref callback will be executed and then you will have a reference to the wrapped components instance.
3. Can a component, such as <Content />, which is a child also be used as a standalone component elsewhere in the application? - No it can't be used as a standalone component. 
4. What trick can a parent use to share all props with it’s children - By using the spread operator you can have more felxibility sharing props without changing prop names.

## Vocabulary 
- props.children - A special prop that is used to display whatever you include between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component.
- composition - The act of combining parts or elements to form a whole. The UI building blocks in React Apps.
