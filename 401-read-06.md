# Authentication

## Review, Research, and Discussion
- Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms)
A software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one single instance.
- Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes
If you need only one instance of an object you can use the singleton pattern to ensure only one object can be created no matter how many times it is instantiated.
- If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it?
- I would create functions that execute during the life cycle of a request to the express server.


## Vocabulary 
Middleware - functions that have ccess to the request object, reponse object, and the next middleware function in the applications request response cycle .
Router Middleware - router level middleware are bound by using the router.use or router.METHOD functions.
Dynamic Module Loading - you can recieve much faster load times.
Singleton Pattern - A software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one single instance.
CRUD -> REST Method Matches - In REST style programming we should use HTTP methods as our building blocks.
Mock Testing - Approach to unit testing that helps yoiu make assertions about how the code that is being tested is interacting with other modules.

## Preview
1. Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
- I had heard of hashing before but now I understand more how it works.
- Basic authentication is the simplest way of enforcing access controls.
- Authentication is the basic way to accessing data with a stores username and password.
2. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
- I would like to know more about how hacking into databases and decoding hashing works.
- How common is it for applications to use Basic Authentication without hashing the code.
- I would like to know more about different hashing functions.
3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
- I am curious to know what it is like to code authentication with a form of hashing involved.
