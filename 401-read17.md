# AWS: S3 and Lambda

## Review, Research, and Discussion
- Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
    - Standard queues provide best effort ordering meaning they try to output data in which the order they come in but occasionally it will output out of order. FIFO is strictly first in first out meaning it exactly one processing and always outputs in order.
- How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
    - Clients can send back a message/event notifying the server that the message was received.
- What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?
    - The observer pattern which is a software design pattern in which an object maintains a list of dependencies and notifies them automatically of any state changes.
- How do you test an event driven system?
    - There are multiple ways to test event driven systems: Unit tests, End-to-End tests, and service tests.

## Vocabulary
- Server Instances - A copy of the software running on a physical or virtual server.
- Containers - standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies.
- Cloud Services - wide ranges of services designed to provide easy, affordable access to applications and resources without the need for internal infrastructure or hardware.
- Cloud Arhchitecture - refers to the components and subcomponents needed for cloud computing.
- AWS - Provides a vast number of web services that can be used in almost any thinkable way. 
- EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku - They are both commmonly used clous services that allow apps to be depolyed and scaled. However, although EC2/Beanstalk is a little more complex and requires more maintanence, it offers more flexibility and scalability if your project demands great computational resources. Heroku is great for smaller apps or testing MVP but is limited in terms of scalability and handling larger projects.
