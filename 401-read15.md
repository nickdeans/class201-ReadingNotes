# Trees

## Common Terms 
- Node - A tree node is a component that can contain its own values and refer to other nodes.
- Root - first node at the start of a tree
- K - number that specifies the max children a node may have.
- Left - reference to one node in a tree.
- Right - reference to other child node.
- Edge - link between parent and child node.
- Leaf - node with no children.
- Height - number of edges from root to the furthest.

## Traversals
Traversing trees are important and gives the ability to search for a node, print out the contents of a tree, and more.
1. Pre-order: root >> left >> right
    - means that the root has to be locked in first. When we call preOrder for the first time the root will be added to the call stack.
2. In-order: left >> root >> right 
3. Post-order: left >> right >> root
4. Breadth First: traversal that iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node by node.

## Binary Tree Vs K-ary Trees
Binary trees restrict the number of children to two. With K-ary trees, they may have more than two children. We use K to refer to the maximum number of children that each Node has to have.

## Big O
The Big O for time complexity for inserting a new node and searching for a specific node is O(n). The Big O space complexity for a node insertion using breadth first insertion will be O(W).

## Binary Search Tree 
A Binary Search Tree or BST is a type of tree that does not have structure attached top it. Nodes are organized in a way that all values that are smaller than the root are placed to the left, and all values that are larger than the root are placed to the right.
