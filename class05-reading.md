# Heroku Deployment

## Using Heroku
To use Heroku with Node.js you must first have the latest versions of Node, npm, and it. See below for latest version or newer.

```
$ node --version
v12.16.3

$ npm --version
6.14.4

$ git --version
git version 2.17.0
```

### Create an App
To create an app on Heroku which will prepare Heroku to receive your source code use the example below.

```
$ heroku create
```

After creating the app you will then deploy the app using the example below.

```
$ git push heroku main
```

To ensure the app is deployed make sure at least one instance of the app is running using the code below.

```
$ heroku ps:scale web=1
```

Now you can go to the app at the URL generated by its app name. As a shortcut you can use the code below.

```
$ heroku open
```
