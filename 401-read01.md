# Exception Handling and Debugging

## Debugging for Begginners 
We may be tempted to look at broken code for hours and try to problem solve but the best way to debug code is by using a debbugging tool or debugger.

**Debugger or Debugging** - means running code in a debugging tool like Visual Studio to find the exact place where you made a programming mistake. 
    - Using a debugger effectively like everything else takes time and skill. It is a fundamental and efficient tool that every developer should use.

Ask yourself the right questions and examine your assumptions.
- Am I using the right API?
- Does my code contain any typos?
- Did I make any changes to my code?
- Did I expect an object or variable to contain a certain value?


**Debugging Mode** - Running an app within a debugger (debugging mode) means thats the debugger will actively monitor everything that is happening as the program runs. 

## Try/Catch Block for Exceptions
Place any code statements that might raise or throw an exception in a "TRY" block and place statements used to handle the exception in one or more "CATCH" blocks below the "TRY".

## Statement Keywords (C#)
**Selection Statments** - if, else, switch, case
**Iteration Statements** - do, for, foreach, in, while
**Jump Statements** - break, continue, default, goto, return, yield
**Exception Handling Statements** - throw, try-catch, try-finally, try-catch-finally
**Checked and Unchecked** - checked, unchecked
**Fixed Statement** - fixed
**Locked Statement** - lock

## Try Statements and Exceptions
A "TRY" statement specifies a code block subject to error-handling or cleanup code. The "TRY" block must be followed by a "CATCH" block, a "FINALLY" block, or both.

A "CATCH" block has access to an exception object that contains information about the error.

A "FINALLY" block adds determinism to your program.

A Catch clause specifies what type of excetion to catch and this must be either System.Exception or a subclass of System.Exception.

Exception Filters are added in a catch clause by adding a when clause.

## Throwing Exceptions
Exceptions can be thrown either by a runtime or in user code. Throw was always a statement prior to 7.0 but it can be used as an exception.
