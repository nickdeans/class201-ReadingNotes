# Introducing CSS

## What is CSS?

- CSS allows you to create rules to transform what your HTML will look like.
- These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed.

**CSS** rules contain two parts: a _selector_ and a _declaration_

1. Selectors - Indicate which element the rule applies to.

1. Declaration - Indicate how the elements referred to in the selector should be styles.

**CSS** declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a _property_ and a _value_

1. Properties - Indicate the aspects of the element you want to change.

1. Values - Specify the settings you want to use for the chosen properties.

## How CSS Rules Cascade

- If there are two or more rules that apply to the same element, it is important to understand which will take precedence. The latter of the rules will always take precedence.
- Inheritance - If you specify the font-family or color properties on the body, they will apply to most of the child elements.

## Color

**Color** not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reaction.

### Three ways to specify colors in CSS

1. RGB Values
1. Hex Codes
1. Color Names

**Contrast** - Make sure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color otherwise people will not be able to read your content.
