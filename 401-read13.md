## Review, Research, Discussion
- What does it mean that web sockets are bidirectional? Why is this useful?
    - Whereas HTTP relies only on a clients request to give a response from the server, Web sockets are bidirectional meaning a server can send real-time updates asynchronously without a client sending a request.
- Does socket.io use HTTP? Why?
    - Yes because HTPP and websocket servers co-exist on the same TCP port. A socket.io server will attach to an HTTP server so it can serve its client and also provides a fallabck for situations websockets may not be supported.
- What happens when a client emits an event?
    - The event will be sent to the server and the server will choose to react or not and can emit an event as well.
- What happens when a server emits an event?
    - It will be emitted to all socket connections and client sid sockets can respond to the event as well. 
- What happens if a client “misses” an event?
    - It means that the client will choose to not repond to the event and not emit anything.
- How can we mitigate this?
    - We can use handlers to respond to all events emitted from the server.

## Vocabulary
- Socket - Endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs on a network.
- Web Socket - defines an API establishing socket connections bewteen browser and server and allows a persistent connection between client and server which is bidirectional.
- Socket.io - JS library that enable real time, bidriectional, and event based communication between clients and servers.
- Client - computer or program that sends requests to another program or computer to access services.
- Server - computer or program which that provides functionality for other programs or devices called "clients"
- OSI Model - Seven layer framework that  describes the functions of a networking or telecommunication system.
- TCP Model - Concise version of the OSI model and contains 4 layers: Process/Application, Host-to-host?transport, Internet, Network Access/link.
- TCP - Transmission control protocol: Manages our connection and sending and receiving of packets.
- UDP - Provides checksums for data integrity and port numbers for addressing different functions.
- Packets - formatted unit of data that consists of control information and user data. The user data is known as the payload.
