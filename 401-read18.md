# AWS: API, Dynamo, and Lambda

## Review, Research, and Discussion
- Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
    - Standard queues provide best effort ordering meaning they try to output data in which the order they come in but occasionally it will output out of order. FIFO is strictly first in first out meaning it exactly one processing and always outputs in order.
- How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
    - Clients can send back a message/event notifying the server that the message was received.
- What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?
    - The observer pattern which is a software design pattern in which an object maintains a list of dependencies and notifies them automatically of any state changes.
- How do you test an event driven system?
    - There are multiple ways to test event driven systems: Unit tests, End-to-End tests, and service tests.

## Vocabulary
- Serverless Functions - Event driven code that is only invoked when triggered by a request.
- Cloud Storage - Remote storaage that is maintained by a third party. Your data can be stored safely at a remote location so that the data does not take up any space on your machine.
