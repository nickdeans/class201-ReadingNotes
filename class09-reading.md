# Refactoring

## Functional Programming 
A a way of building he structure and elements of computer programs.

- Pure functions return the same result if given the same arguments.
- If the function reads external files it is not a pure function.
- If the function relies on a random number generator then it is not pure.
- Pure functions code is easier to test.
- With recursion, we keep variable immutable.
- Slugify means lower case, remove useless whit spaces, and replace them with hyphens.
- toLowerCAse converts strings to all lower case.
- trim emoves whitespace from both ends of string.
- split and join replace all instances of match with replacement of a given string.
- The map method transforms a collection y applying a function to all of its elements and building a new collection from the returned values.
