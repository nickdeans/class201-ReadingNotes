## Array.map()
Arrray.map() is a method that creates a new array filled with the result of the actions requested on each element of an existing array.

## Array.reduce()
Array.reduce() is a method that takes in provided actions on each element of an array and results in a single output.

## Superagent
Provide code snippets showing how to use superagent() to fetch data from a URL and log the result:
- With normal Promise .then() syntax
- Again with async / await syntax
First, in order to use superagent you must install superagent as a dependency using the words below within your terminal command line.
```
npm install superagent 
```
Second, you will need to have the line of code provided below for your js file to use or require superagent.
```
const superagent = require('superagent')
```
Third, you can use superagent to fetch data from a url or api and log the result using a promise or an await/async function. To use a Promise an example below will show the correct syntax with a .then().
```
superagent.get('url target').then(data => do something with the data).catch(error => comnsole.error(error));
```
To us a async/await function with superagent you will use the syntax provided below:
```
async function superagentExample = () => {const data = await superagent.get('url target'); do something with the data}
```

## Promises 
A promise is an object that may result in a single value some time in the future. This may be a resolved or unresolved value.Promises will start doing any task you may assign it immediately after the constructor is invoked or called.

## Callback Functions 
Callback functions can be either syncronous or asynchronous. Array.map and array.reduce are examples of syncronous functions and promises and async/await functions can be used for asynchronous actions.
