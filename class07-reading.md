# REST

- REST - Representational State Transfer is an architectural style that provides standards between computer systems on the web, which make it easier for diffferent systems to comunicate with each other. 

- RESTful - REST-compliant systems are characterized by how they are stateless and seperate he concerns for of client and server.

- In the REST architectural style, the implementation of the client and server can be done independently.

- Systems that follow the REST paradigm are stateless, meaning the server does not need to know anything about what state the clients in and vice versa. 

- In REST, the client sends requests to obtain or modify resourcesand servers send reponses to the request.

- REST requires a request from the client. Requests consist of:
    - HTTP verb which tells what what operation to perform
    - a header which allows the client to pass information about the request.
    -  path to resource.
    - optional message body that contains data.

- HTTP Verbs -
    - GET - retrieve a specific resource by id or collection or resources
    - POST - create a new resource
    - PUT - update a specific resource by id
    - DELETE - removes specific esource by id
